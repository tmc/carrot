Simple amqplib wrapper to provide a nicer `AMQP`_ interface.

*Note* This software is not finished. And is likely to change drastically
in the near future.

.. _`AMQP`: http://amqp.org

Introduction
------------

`carrot` is a messaging queue framework built on top of `py-amqplib`_. It
encapsulates a simple workflow and attempts to fall back to sane defaults.
`carrot` supports loading settings from the local environment or `Django`_
configuration (there is no hard dependancy on `Django`_). `carrot`_ was
created through inspiration obtained through the `Rabbits and warrens`_
article below.

Installation
-------------

    You can install ``carrot`` either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
    or from source.

    To install using ``pip``:

::

        $ pip install carrot

    To install using ``easy_install``

        $ easy_install carrot

    If you have downloaded a source tarball you can install it
    in the following way:

::

        $ python setup.py build
        # python setup.py install # as root


Example
-------

    This is a `carrot` implementation of the example publisher and
    consumer described in the article `Rabbits and warrens`_

        >>> from carrot.messaging import Publisher, Consumer

        >>> class PostOfficePublisher(Publisher):
        ...     exchange = "sorting_room"
        ...     routing_key = "jason"
        
        >>> class PostOfficeConsumer(Consumer):
        ...     queue = "po_box"
        ...     exchange = "sorting_room"
        ...     routing_key = "json"
        ...
        ...     def receieve(self, message_data, message):
        ...         """This is the method that is called whenever we
        ...         receieve a message in this queue."""
        ...         print("Received: %s" % message_data)

    By default every message is encoded using `JSON`_, if you don't want
    this you have to set the ``encoding`` attribute in the producer and
    the ``decoding`` attribute in the consumer to ``lambda x: x``.

    There are lots of other options for producers and consumers for which
    the only documentation right now is the source code (sorry!)

    To start sending and receveing messages with these classes, you first
    have to configure the AMQP server for your django app. If you have a
    `RabbitMQ`_ server running on localhost you can add these settings 
    to your ``settings.py``:

::

        AMQP_SERVER = "localhost"
        AMQP_PORT = 5672
        AMQP_USER = "guest"
        AMQP_PASSWORD = "guest"
        AMQP_VHOST = "/"

    First we have to set up the connection instance, and map it to the
    publishers and consumers:

        >>> from carrot.connection import AMQPConnection
        >>> po_publisher = PostOfficePublisher(connection=AMQPConnection)
        >>> po_consumer = PostOfficeConsumer(connection=AMQPConnection)


    Then, finally, we can send and receive some messages:

        >>> po_publisher.send({"My message": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]})
        >>> po_publisher.close()
        >>> po_consumer.next()
        Received: {"My message": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]} from channel #1
